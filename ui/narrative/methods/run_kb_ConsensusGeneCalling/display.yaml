parameters:
  assembly_ref:
    ui-name: "Input Assembly"
    short-hint: "Assembly to gene-call."
    long: "Select a KBase Assembly object. The app predicts features and produces an annotated Genome object."
  output_genome_name:
    ui-name: "Output Genome name"
    short-hint: "Name for the output Genome object."
    long: "A KBaseGenomes.Genome object will be saved with this name."
  backend:
    ui-name: "Gene caller backend"
    short-hint: "Which gene calling engine(s) to run."
    long: "Default uses the Prokka stack (Prodigal + barrnap + tRNAscan-SE). Prodigal-only is CDS only."
  call_cds:
    ui-name: "Call CDS"
    short-hint: "Predict protein-coding genes (CDS)."
    long: "If unchecked, no CDS will be predicted."

    ui-name: "Call RNAs"
    short-hint: "Predict RNA features (tRNA/rRNA when available)."
    long: "If unchecked, RNA callers are skipped."
  min_contig_length:
    ui-name: "Min contig length"
    short-hint: "Skip contigs shorter than this."
    long: "Contigs below this threshold are ignored during calling."
  genetic_code:
    ui-name: "Genetic code"
    short-hint: "NCBI translation table (default 11)."
    long: "Used for CDS translation and start/stop interpretation."
  min_cds_length_nt:
    ui-name: "Min CDS length (nt)"
    short-hint: "Filter CDS shorter than this length."
    long: "Short predicted CDS below this threshold are removed."
  include_partial_genes:
    ui-name: "Include partial genes"
    short-hint: "Keep truncated/edge predictions."
    long: "If enabled, partial/edge features are retained when callers emit them."
  coordinate_system:
    ui-name: "Coordinate system"
    short-hint: "Output coordinate convention."
    long: "Default is 1-based closed (inclusive start/stop)."

description: |
  This app predicts genomic features (CDS and optionally tRNA/rRNA) from a single Assembly
  and saves the result as a KBase Genome object. It is intended for structural annotation / gene calling
  workflows where you want features created first (and optionally run functional annotation later).
